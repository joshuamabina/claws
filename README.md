> **`Heads up!`** This is work in progress.

The Claws Project is a library and collection of command line digital forensics tools that allow you to investigate the authenticity of image, \*video and \*audio files. The library can be incorporated into larger digital forensics tools and the command line tools can be directly used to find evidence.

> **`Heads up!`** \* means feature(s) is a much, much more work in progress. 

It began as project by students and their facilitating instructors
at the [University of Dodoma, College of Informatics and Virtual Education](http://cive.hakikidawa.org/).

This is not, at all, a new thing. I've got my inspiration and code snippets from so many other places. Just to mention a few:

- [Ghiro - automated image forensics tool](http://www.getghiro.org/)
- [elsamuko forensics](https://sites.google.com/site/elsamuko/forensics)
- [phoenix - Image Forensics](https://github.com/ebemunk/phoenix)
- [fotoforensics](http://fotoforensics.com/)

## Installation

You are required to have the following libraries:

- GCC compiler `# build-essentials`
- Open-CV (http://opencv.org/) `# used for image processing`
- Exiv2 (http://exiv2.org/) `# used for meta-data extraction`
- Boost (http://www.boost.org/) `# used to make life easier`

> **`ProTip`** I have only tried and succeeded at building the project on a Debian-based OS. Feel free to experiment with any distro of your choice - or you're welcome to [try mine](https://www.bunsenlabs.org).
